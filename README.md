## Project Description:
I have a theory and it really is pretty simple. If you can't explain something well or if you can't
create something from your knowledge, you don't know it! The Flashcard app I created reflects that idea.
Rather than having a traditional flashcard this flashcard asks you to type an answer then compare it to a previous answer.
Then if you think your answer more accurtaely address the question you can update the answer with your answer! 

Plus, the app includes a timer (only works for minutes) that keeps your study sessions exactly as long as you define them.
